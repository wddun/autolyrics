Praise
Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord (you got it)
Praise the Lord
Let everything (let everything)
(Hey) that has breath
(Hey) praise the Lord
(Hey) praise the Lord
I'll praise in the valley
Praise on the mountain (yeah)
I'll praise when I'm sure
Praise when I'm doubting (yes, sir)
I'll praise when outnumbered
Praise when surrounded
'Cause praise is the water
My enemies drown in
As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul (c'mon)
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul (hey)
I'll praise when I feel it
And I'll praise when I don't
I'll praise 'cause I know
You're still in control
Because my praise is a weapon
It's more than a sound (more than a sound)
Oh, my praise is the shout
That brings Jericho down (oh)
As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to
Praise the Lord (c'mon)
Oh, my soul
(So I'm gonna) praise the Lord
Oh, my soul
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
So how could I keep it inside?
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul
(Praise the Lord)
Come on, let me see that dance
Put a dance on it tonight
If you're grateful
Come on, aye, aye
I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign
Praise 'cause You reign
Praise 'cause You rose and defeated the grave
I'll praise 'cause You're faithful
Praise 'cause You're true
Praise 'cause there's nobody greater than You, I'll pray
I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign
(You reign) praise 'cause You reign
Praise 'cause You rose and defeated the grave
I'll praise 'cause You're faithful
Praise 'cause You're true
Praise 'cause there's nobody greater than You
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul (come on, come on, come on, come on)
I gotta praise the Lord
Oh, my soul
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul (yes, my Lord)
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul
I won't be quiet
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside?
(Oh, I won't be quiet)
I won't be quiet (my God)
My God is alive (how could I?)
How could I keep it inside?
(Oh, I won't be quiet)
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside?
I gotta praise the Lord
Oh, my soul
Let everything
That has breath
Hey, hey (praise the Lord)
Hey, hey (praise the Lord)
