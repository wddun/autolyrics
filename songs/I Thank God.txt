I Thank God
Wandering into the night
Wanting a place to hide
This weary soul, this bag of bones
And I tried with all my mind
And I just can't win the fight
I'm slowly drifting, oh vagabond
And just when I ran out of road
I met a man I didn't know
And he told me
That I was not alone
He picked me up
He turned me around
He placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
Because He healed my heart
He changed my name
Forever free, I'm not the same
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
I thank God
I cannot deny what I see
Got no choice but to believe
My doubts are burning
Like ashes in the wind
So, so long to my old friends
Burden and bitter night
You can't just keep them moving
No, you ain't welcome here
From now 'til I walk
The streets of gold
I'll sing of how You saved my soul
This wayward son
Has found his way back home
He picked me up
Turned me around
Placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
Because He healed my heart
Changed my name
Forever free, I'm not the same
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
Oh, I thank God
Oh, I thank God
Oh, I thank God
Oh, I thank God
Hell lost another one
I am free, I am free, I am free
Hell lost another one
I am free, I am free, I am free
Hell lost another one
I am free, I am free, yes I am free
Hell lost another one
I am free, I am free, I am free
Hell lost another one
I am free, I am free, I am free
Hell lost another one
I am free, I am free, I am free
Hell lost another one
I am free, I am free, I am free
Hell lost another one
I am free, I am free, I am free
He picked me up
He turned me around
He placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
Because He healed my heart
He changed my name
Forever free, I'm not the same
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
I thank God
And if He did it for me, He can do it for you
If He did it for me, He can do it for you
